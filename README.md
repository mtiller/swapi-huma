## Star Wars API with Huma

I wanted to play around with some idea around mixing hypermedia with OpenAPI.
So, I wanted to do it with non-work related content, so I decided to implement
the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev) but leverage
[`huma`](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/huma).

This is intended as a playground to play around with ideas, so don't take anything here very seriously.
